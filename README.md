# InkLab - World of Warcraft Database Browser

A comprehensive desktop application for browsing and exploring World of Warcraft (Octo WoW) game data, built with Wails, Go, and React.

## Features

### Database Browser

- **Items**: search by name, class, subclass, and inventory slot; WoW-style tooltips; icons served from the local client set
- **Sets**: item sets by class, with set bonuses
- **NPCs**: browse by creature type or beast family; spawn pins on zone maps; loot, quests, abilities, trainer and vendor listings; locally-rendered 3D models
- **Quests**: browse by zone or category; objectives, rewards, and quest givers
- **Objects**: browse by type; loot tables and spawn locations
- **Zones**: every zone with its map and the loot obtainable there
- **Spells**: browse by class or skill; descriptions resolved locally from client DBC data
- **Factions**: reputation rewards, reputation quests, quest givers, and faction members
- **Races**: racial traits and starting attributes
- **Icons**: every icon in the local client set, cross-referenced to the items and spells that use it (hover any icon for a copyable name)

### AtlasLoot Integration

- 7 categories: Instances, Sets, Factions, PvP, World Bosses, World Events, Crafting
- Hierarchical navigation (Category → Module → Table → Items)
- Drop chance information where available

### More

- **Talents**: talent tree browser and calculator with shareable build codes
- **Maps**: flight-path network browser per continent and zone
- **Favorites**: bookmark entities for quick access
- **Global Search**: find items, NPCs, quests, spells, and objects from anywhere

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24 + Wails v2.11
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: SQLite 3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom WoW theme

### Data Pipeline

The application supports two modes of data operation:

1. **End User Mode** (Default):

   - Uses the embedded SQLite database (`data/inklab.db`)
   - Syncs missing or updated data directly from `octowow.st` via the built-in Sync Service
   - No external database dependencies required

2. **Developer Mode** (Optional):
   - Can connect to a local MySQL instance for custom data export
   - Python export scripts available in `scripts/` (Optional usage)
   - Useful for initial database population or large schema updates

**Sync Service (`backend/services/`)**:

- Scrapes and parses data from `octowow.st/db`
- Supports Items, NPCs, Quests, and Objects (spell text is resolved locally from client DBC data)
- Multi-threaded worker pools for fast synchronization
- "AtlasLoot Missing" mode to find gaps in local data

## Installation

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/brues-code/inklab/releases/latest).

2. **Extract** the archive anywhere and run the executable (`InkLab.exe` on Windows). The database ships embedded in the binary and is unpacked into a `data/` folder next to it on first launch — no external database or other setup required.

3. **Run the Client Data import.** Icons, zone maps, and other client-derived reference data are built locally from your WoW client. In the app, open **Tools → Import → Client Data (icons, maps, DBC)**, set the base path to your client folder (the one containing `Data\*.MPQ`), and run it once.

Upgrading is the same: newer releases refresh the embedded database automatically on launch, and your locally-built icons and maps are kept.

## Development

### Building from Source

Prerequisites: Go 1.24+, Node.js 18+, Wails v2.11+

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brues-code/inklab.git
cd inklab

# Install dependencies
go mod download
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Run in development mode
wails dev

# Or produce a production binary in build/bin
wails build
```

### Database Schema

The application uses a SQLite database with 30+ tables:

**Core Tables**:

- `item_template`: Items (1:1 MySQL mapping)
- `creature_template`: Creatures
- `quest_template`: Quests
- `spell_template`: Spells
- `gameobject_template`: Objects

**AtlasLoot Tables**:

- `atlasloot_categories`: Categories
- `atlasloot_modules`: Modules
- `atlasloot_tables`: Loot tables
- `atlasloot_items`: Loot entries

**Loot Tables**:

- `creature_loot_template`
- `item_loot_template`
- `gameobject_loot_template`
- `reference_loot_template`
- `disenchant_loot_template`

### Data Update Workflow

1. **Sync Service (Recommended)**:

   - Use the in-app **Sync** page to sync data from `octowow.st`.
   - This approach is incremental and does not require external tools.

2. **Developer Export (Legacy/Full Rebuild)**:
   - If you have a local Turtle WoW MySQL database, you can use `scripts/export_all_data.py` to dump JSONs.
   - Using `wails dev` with no existing DB will trigger an import from `data/*.json`.

### Icon Management

Icon images are never downloaded from the network. The Client Data import decodes them straight from your WoW client's MPQ archives into `data/icons/`, and the UI serves them from there. The icon-fix tooling only discovers missing icon *names* (e.g. `inv_sword_01`) from `octowow.st/db` so the locally-extracted images can resolve; anything still unresolved falls back to a question-mark placeholder.
